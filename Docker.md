1. What is Docker? How is it different from a Virtual Machine?

        Answer:
        Docker is a platform for building, running, and managing containers.
        
        Containers are lightweight, share the host OS kernel, and only package the application + its dependencies.
        
        Virtual Machines include a full guest OS, making them heavier.

        ðŸ‘‰ In short: Containers start faster and use less resources compared to VMs.

2. What is a container? Whatâ€™s inside a Docker image?

       Answer:
    
       Container: A running instance of a Docker image. Itâ€™s an isolated environment with its own filesystem, processes, and network.
       Image: A read-only blueprint that contains everything needed to run an app (base OS libraries, runtime, app code, config).

3. Difference between Image and Container?

       Answer:
    
       Image: Static blueprint (like a class).
       Container: Running instance of an image (like an object).

4. What is a Dockerfile? Can you explain a simple one?

       Answer:
       A Dockerfile is a script with instructions to build an image.
       Example for a Spring Boot app:
    
       FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim //This provides the Java 17 JDK environment so your app can run.
       COPY target/*.jar app.jar // Copies the built application JAR (target/*.jar) from your local machine into the containerâ€™s filesystem. Inside the container, it will be available as app.jar in the working directory (/ by default unless you set WORKDIR).
       ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"] // Defines the command that runs when the container starts, this is how it executes: java -jar app.jar


Commands:

1. docker info

        Checks if Docker daemon is running and provides system-wide information.
        
        Shows version, storage driver, number of containers, images, etc.
        ðŸ‘‰ Interview note: Use it when troubleshooting if Docker is alive.

2. docker build -t current-usa-time-v2 .

       Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (.), that's why dot at last
       -t tags the image with a name (current-usa-time).
       ðŸ‘‰ Example: After this, you can run docker images and see it listed.

3. docker run -p dockerPort:codePort current-usa-time-v2

          Runs a container from the image current-usa-time-v2.
    
          -p maps host port â†’ container port
            container port= application yaml port
            host port you can give anything

       Example: -p 8888:7777 means access app on localhost:8888.
       ðŸ‘‰ Host port = left side, container port = right side.


4. docker tag current-usa-time seturini/current-usa-time-v2:latest1

       Creates a new tag for an existing local image.
    
       Prepares the image to be pushed to a registry under a username (seturini) and version (latest).

5. docker push seturini/current-usa-time-v2:latest1

       Pushes the tagged image to Docker Hub (or registry).
       ðŸ‘‰ After this, others can pull and run your image.

6. docker pull seturini/current-usa-time-v2:latest1

       Downloads an image from Docker Hub (or other registry) to your local machine.
       ðŸ‘‰ Useful if you want to run an image without building it locally.



7. docker ps

        Lists all running containers.
        
        Shows ID, name, status, ports, etc.

8. docker ps -a

       Lists all containers (running + stopped + exited).
       ðŸ‘‰ Useful to see history.

9. docker stop <containerId>

       Stops a running container gracefully (sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if needed).

10. docker-compose.yml

       YAML file used to define and configure multi-container applications.
    
       Instead of many docker run commands, you define services, networks, volumes here.
       ðŸ‘‰ Example: A Spring Boot app + MySQL DB together.

11. docker run

        Creates and starts a new container from an image.
        ðŸ‘‰ Every docker run creates a new container.

12. docker start <containerId>

        Starts an existing (stopped) container.
        ðŸ‘‰ Difference: docker run = new container, docker start = restart old one.

13. docker stop <containerId>

        Stops a running container (gracefully).
        ðŸ‘‰ Mention: To force stop instantly, use docker kill.

14. docker rm <containerId>

        Removes a stopped container permanently.
        ðŸ‘‰ Must stop container first, otherwise add -f flag.

15. docker-compose.override.yml

        Optional file to override or extend settings in docker-compose.yml.
    
        Useful for dev/test differences (e.g., enable debug mode locally but not in prod).

16. docker logs <containerId>

        Displays logs (stdout/stderr) from a container.
        ðŸ‘‰ Add -f to stream logs live (docker logs -f containerId).
